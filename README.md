# METU University Student Courses

![Face-to-Face Course](https://bmeqhxsikltbwjf8.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/20221230192228_IMG_5651-min.JPG)

This repository serves as a **general portfolio** documenting the training sessions I have delivered under the **METU MECH (Middle East Technical University Mechanical & Innovation Society)**. It showcases both the online sessions shared via YouTube and the broader outreach achieved through additional in‑person courses.

> **Impact:** In addition to the online trainings listed below, I have conducted **13 face‑to‑face workshops**, reaching **over 500 students**. These in‑person sessions complemented the online curriculum and helped engage a wider audience with practical demonstrations and Q\&A opportunities.

## Online Training Sessions
